# twitter-scrapingg
The above code is written in Python and it has multiple functionalities. 
It can scrape tweets using a specified keyword or hashtag from Twitter, store the scraped data in a MongoDB database, and also download the data in CSV or JSON format. 
The code uses several Python libraries, such as snscrape, pandas, pymongo, and streamlit.

First, the code imports the necessary libraries and sets up the query for scraping the tweets. 
The query specifies a keyword or hashtag to search for, along with a date range for the tweets. 
The code also sets a limit of 100 tweets to scrape.

The code then uses the snscrape library to scrape the tweets and stores them in a list. 
It loops through the tweets until it reaches the specified limit, and then creates a pandas DataFrame from the list of tweets. 
The DataFrame includes the date, username, and content of each tweet.

The next section of the code connects to a MongoDB database and creates a collection to store the scraped data.
The current timestamp is also added to the data as a reference.

Finally, the code uses the streamlit library to create a web-based interface for the user to interact with the code. 
The user can input a keyword or hashtag to search for, select a date range, and specify the number of tweets to scrape. 
The code then uses the Tweepy library to scrape the tweets and create a pandas DataFrame from the scraped data. 
The user can then choose to save the data to the database or download it in CSV or JSON format.

Overall, this code provides a useful tool for scraping and storing Twitter data for analysis or further processing. 
It uses several popular Python libraries and provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the code.
